<center><h1 style="font-size:27px">Variants of Concern (VOCs)</h1></center>
<p>Regular COVID-19 tests cannot be used to identify the presence of COVID-19 variants. Specimens which have tested positive are sent for further testing to determine the strain of the virus. As such, it can be difficult to make quantitative comparisons of VOCs vs non-VOCs, as further testing results in delays between the initial reporting of COVID-19 positivity.</p>
<p>Currently, there are 3 VOCs in Canada being closely monitored: The B117 strain first detected in the UK; The B1351 strain first detected in South Africa; and the P1 strain first detected in Brazil. The VOC data is from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). Please refer to the Special Report regarding VOC data on our website, available <a href="https://opencovid.ca/work/special-reports/">here</a>.</p>
