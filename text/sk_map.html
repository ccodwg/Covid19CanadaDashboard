Saskatchewan transitioned to using new health region (HR) boundaries on August 4, 2020, going from 6 HRs to 13. These new bounaries will be displayed on the map for date ranges beginning 2020-01-25 and ending on 2020-08-04 or later and date ranges beginning after 2020-08-03. Otherwise, the old HR boundaries will be used. Note that when displaying the old boundaries, values for dates after 2020-08-03 rely on case and death numbers that have been approximately mapped from the new HR boundaries to the old HR boundaries.<br><br>
