Saskatchewan transitioned to using new health region (HR) boundaries on August 4, 2020, going from 6 HRs to 13. These new bounaries will be displayed on the map for date ranges beginning 2020-01-25 and ending on 2020-08-04 or later and date ranges beginning and ending on 2020-08-04 and later. Otherwise, the old HR boundaries will be used. For dates after 2020-08-04 using old boundaries, our dataset approximately maps cases from the new boundaries to the old boundaries.
