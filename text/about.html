<u>About the Data</u>

<p>The <b>COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group</b> collects information on confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in Canada. Each line in our dataset represents a unique case. Information such as age, sex, health region location, and history of travel are included, where available, with sources included as a reference for each entry. Data are entered manually and once updated daily. All data are exclusively collected from publicly available sources including government reports, government websites, and news media.</p>

<u>Interpreting Maps</u>

<p>The case/mortality maps show case and mortaltiy absolute or per capita counts by health region. Darker colours indicate a higher number of cases/mortality in that health region than ligher colours. If health region is not reported for a case/mortality, it is not included in the map but is detailed at the bottom of the page in text.</p>

<p>The travel map shows cases exposed through international travel, where reported. Darker blue indicates a higher number of cases associated with travel to that country than lighter blue. Some cases are associated with travel to multiple countries, therefore the sum may not equal the total number of cases with travel exposure. Where specific countries of travel were not identified, these cases were excluded.</p>

<u> VOCs Data</u>

<p>Currently, there are 3 VOCs in Canada being closely monitored: The B117 strain first detected in the UK; The B1351 strain first detected in South Africa; and the P1 strain first detected in Brazil. The VOC data is from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). Please refer to the Special Report regarding VOC data on our website, available <a href="https://opencovid.ca/work/special-reports/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The time series for VOC data begins on February 4, 2021, although VOC were first detected in Canada in late 2020. Hence, cases collected before 04-02-2021 are summed and added to the total number of variant cases, but are missing from the daily plots. Furthermore, the data for daily case numbers for VOCs is only collected on weekdays, resulting in zero cases of VOCs being reported on weekends.</p>
